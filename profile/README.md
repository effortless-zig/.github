## Effortless Zig

Effortless Zig is a one stop shop of zig libraries (All libraries in or linked must be made zig through and through, unless really required). It contains both its own set of custom libraries as well as 
external libraries when a library is so good a redevelop will just end up being a carbon copy of the orginal.

There are 3 promises of effortless design:
- Build From Source: All libraries should maintain their own implementations rather than importing others (unless it is meant to be an abstraction ontop of something else or is std).
- The easy way should be the right way: All libraries should make the easiest way of using it be the most performant and safe.
- We documented: The library should be well commented (where needed) and well documented with markdown files.
- Tested: Anything complex or error-prone must be tested and testing suites must be maintained to the same standard as the libraries itself.
- Standardised: If there is a way of doing something that is effective and proven (and other options aren't significantly better), do that thing.
